# Sinch And HubSpot Integration Demo 

## Problem: 
Given that we need to manage a list of customers from a CRM such as HubSpot 
from various channels such as Messenger, Viber, SMS, WhatsApp. It is a pain to manage api integration for individual 
channel. Developers need to spend quite time for learning, configuring different APIs. This demo will show how can we use one api that 
can work across multiple channels , reducing the learning curve to minimal , and setting up quickly. 

## What in this demo:

The demo will show how different clients from various channels can interact to the application. From there, we can save the information of the 
client to HubSpot, and Hubspot can use a universal Conversation API to interact back to the client. 

The demo will use Facebook Messenger, and SMS for the demo. Of course, we can configure more channels.
